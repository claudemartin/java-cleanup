/**
 * 
 * This is an interface to add cleanup actions to any type. The method
 * {@link #registerCleanup(Consumer, Object)} must be run at the end of or after construction (code
 * run after that could invalidate the object, which could lead to problems). The configured
 * <i>cleanup</i> action is run when <code>this</code> does not exist anymore. Therefore the
 * <i>value</i> must not contain any references to <code>this</code>.
 * <p>
 * You can use {@link #addExceptionHandler(Consumer)} to handle exceptions (e.g. send exceptions to
 * your logging system).

 * <td class="con">
 * <ul class="con">
 * <li>Does not work if you leak a reference to <code>this</code> to the cleanup action. References
 * are often implicit and not visible in the code. Many of such mistakes can not be detected and the
 * object is never garbage collected (memory leak).</li>
 * <li>No guarantee that the code runs when the JVM exits.</li>
 * <li>Invocations are not ordered and you could close the resources in the wrong order.</li>
 * <li>There is still a risk that cleanup is done for incompletely constructed objects.</li>
 * <li>Memory visibility problems, as the cleanup is performed in a daemon thread.</li>
 * <li>Use of locks or other synchronization-based mechanisms within a cleanup can cause deadlock or
 * starvation.</li>

 * A note from the author:<br>
 * I decided to use the name <i>Cleanup</i> because it is simple to understand. However, there is
 * the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html"
 * >try-with-resource statement</a> which is much better if you actually need to close something.
 * <i>Cleanup</i> should be used for code that isn't critical, such as logging and debugging.<br>
 * I recommend using static methods instead of lambdas:<br>
 * {@code foo.registerCleanup(Foo::cleanup); }<br>
 * This is shown in the Example, which you can find in the test-folder. It is very safe and easy to
 * understand for others, as you can include the static method in your API documentation.
